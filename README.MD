### Machine Learning from scratch

The objective of this repository is to explore machine learning algorithms, the depth behind the mathematics, modify them and understand how they are implemented and tried to imitate without using any supporting libraries like tensorflow and pytorch, thus implementing my mathematical knowledge to use.
